## Data Preprocessing
Data is the backbone of any data analytics project. It's the raw material from which valuable insights are extracted. However, before those insights can be uncovered, the data often needs to undergo a crucial transformation process known as data preprocessing.

#### Tools
<h5>Python and Pandas:</h5> Python has become the go-to language for data analysis. Using Jupyter notebooks and the Pandas library, I was able to handle data efficiently. Techniques such as data cleaning, data transformation, and feature engineering were seamlessly executed.

<h5>SQL:</h5> SQL (Structured Query Language) is indispensable when dealing with large datasets and relational databases. It's an excellent tool for data extraction, filtering, and aggregation. I used SQL to combine data from different sources and create a unified dataset for analysis.

<h5>Tableau Prep:</h5> Tableau Prep is a powerful tool for data cleaning and shaping. It simplifies the process of joining, pivoting, and cleaning data. With its intuitive interface, I was able to visualize data transformations and ensure data quality.

#### Techniques
<h5>Data Cleaning:</h5> This involves handling missing values, correcting inaccuracies, and removing duplicates. It's essential to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable.

<h5>Data Transformation:</h5> Data often needs to be restructured or converted into a more usable format. This might include changing data types, scaling, or encoding categorical variables.

<h5>Feature Engineering:</h5> Creating new features from existing ones can uncover valuable patterns. I used this technique to extract meaningful insights from the data.

Data visualization is a powerful tool in the world of data analytics, and Tableau has emerged as a game-changer for creating insightful visualizations and dashboards. I'll share my experience with Tableau, highlighting how I harnessed its capabilities to create compelling visual stories, explored various chart types, harnessed calculated fields, employed filters, and leveraged dashboard actions to convey complex insights.


Tableau offers a diverse array of chart types, from bar charts and scatter plots to heat maps and tree maps. I discovered that selecting the right chart type is crucial in effectively communicating the data's message. For instance, I used bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends over time, and heat maps for highlighting patterns in multidimensional data. Each chart served a specific purpose in conveying insights.

In Tableau, Filters allowed me to create interactive dashboards, enabling users to explore data dynamically. Calculated parameters and fields were invaluable for crafting custom calculations and gaining deeper insights. Additionally, I leveraged features like data blending, trend lines, and storyboarding to craft compelling visual narratives, ultimately transforming data into actionable insights.


### Dashboards 
For the "Incident Management Dashboard" of a cruise line, designed for monitoring three ships and 230 voyages, I created a dynamic visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as "Total Incidents," "Impacted Guests," and "SLA Breaches." To optimize space, I crafted concise and informative titles and tooltips. Unfortunately, I cannot share the data source due to client confidentiality.

In the "Table Management Dashboard" for the same cruise line, I focused on KPIs like "Total Dining" and "Total Guests." I employed space-saving techniques in titles and tooltips, providing a balance between data depth and visualization clarity. Please note that I'm unable to share the data source, as it is subject to client confidentiality.
